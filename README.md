In this repository, you may find the code that was used for the second assignment of the course "Database Systems I" in the fourth semester of the academic year 2022-2023.
The assignment was implemented by User Group III, primarily (only!) by Spyros Kokotos, an Undergraduate student of the Department of Informatics (DI) of Ionian University.
For hosting the website, the domain `skokotos.com` was purchased from GoDaddy and a Dedicated Server was utilized. The Dedicated Server loads the files (index.html, *.php, images, etc) 
onto the Apache Server to ensure permanent accessibility of the website 24/7.
